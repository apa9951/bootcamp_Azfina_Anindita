Notebook for Homework Stage04

-------------------------API PULL------------------------------------

Purpose:
1. Get Most Active Stocks page from Yahoo Finance and loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis or storage.
2. URL https://finance.yahoo.com/most-active

Params and Assumption
1. The Yahoo Finance Most Active Stocks page structure remains consistent (e.g., the first <table> element contains the desired stock data).
2. The first row of the table is the header row.
3. The table has both <th> (header) and <td> (data) cells.
4. The script runs in an environment with internet access and Python packages installed (requests, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas)
5. Yahoo Finance allows access with a standard User-Agent string to prevent bot blocking.
6. Data is small enough to be loaded into memory using Pandas.

Logic Flow
1. Import Libraries: Load requests, BeautifulSoup from bs4, and pandas.
2. Define URL: Assign Yahoo Finance's Most Active Stocks page to the variable url.
3. Send HTTP GET Request: Use requests.get(url, headers=headers) with a User-Agent to mimic a browser.
4. Check Response: Call response.raise_for_status() to ensure the request succeeded (HTTP 200).
5. Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup: Create a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML text.
6. Locate the Table: Use soup.find("table") to retrieve the first <table> element from the HTML.
7. Extract Rows: Iterate through each <tr> (table row) and extract text from <td> and <th> cells.
8. Separate Header and Data: Assume the first row is the header, store it in header, and the rest in data.
9. Create Pandas DataFrame: Pass data and header into pd.DataFrame() to create a structured table.
10. Output Sample: Print the first 5 rows using df.head().


---------------------SCRAPING---------------------
Purpose:
1. Retrieves daily stock price data for a given ticker symbol.
2. first attempts to fetch data from the Alpha Vantage API; If the API request fails (e.g., invalid key, rate limit exceeded, network error), the script falls back to scraping historical data from Yahoo Finance.
3. URL:
a. https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol={symbol}&apikey={ALPHA_KEY} (i used chatGPT to get the API to ALPHAVANTAGE)
b. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/{symbol}/history

Params and Assumption:
1. Alpha Vantage API is available and the ALPHA_KEY is valid.
2. The "Time Series (Daily)" structure in Alpha Vantageâ€™s JSON response does not change.
3. Yahoo Finance's HTML structure remains consistent, with the historical data in the first <table> element.
4. Data volume from both API and scraping is small enough to fit in memory.
5. For scraping, a browser-like User-Agent is used to reduce blocking risk.

Logic Flow:
1. Import Libraries
2. Set Parameter (stock symbol as symbol, ALPHA_KEY as the API key)
3. Primary Data Source: Alpha Vantage API 
4. If error go to fallback Yahoo Finance Scraping
